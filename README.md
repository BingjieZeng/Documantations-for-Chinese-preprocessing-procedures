# Preprocessing-Procedures-for-Chinese
Here I uploaded the language processing files I have written during my internship in Duxiaoman-Baidu (度小满-百度). They are related to the segmentation, POS tagging, and syntactic annotation of Chinese. They had been put into the real annotation process and served as the experimental guidelines to handle the language data from Baidu's search engine.
