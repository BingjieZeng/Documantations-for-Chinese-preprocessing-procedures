# Preprocessing-procedures-for-Chinese

Welcome! :)

In this repository, I have shared the annotation files created during my internship at [Du Xiaoman Financial-Baidu (度小满-百度)](https://www.duxiaoman.com). These files encompass methodologies for `segmentation`, `POS tagging`, and `syntactic annotation` of Chinese text. They have been practically applied as experimental guidelines for processing language data from Baidu's search engine.

Throughout the project, our team continuously refined these guidelines, resulting in multiple versions for certain procedures, such as segmentation. While these annotation instructions are grounded in the standards set by previous corpus builders, we have evolved them significantly to better suit the requirements of training NLP models.

It's important to acknowledge that these guidelines are not without shortcomings. There may be conflicts within the instruction entries, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvement.

My internship concluded in 2022, and unfortunately, I was unable to continue the project or complete the subsequent documentation. I am hopeful that I will revisit and further these works soon, as I embark on developing a quantitative index calculation tool for the Chinese language.

Thank you for your interest!
